                <p class="article-paragraph">Money plays a crucial role in our lives, serving as a medium of exchange and a store of value. Its value is influenced by economic factors such as inflation and interest rates. Inflation reduces the purchasing power of money over time, while interest rates can affect its future value. Psychologically, the value of money impacts happiness, with research showing that beyond a certain income level, additional money has a diminishing effect on well-being. Socially, money affects status and can contribute to inequality.</p>

                <p class="article-paragraph">Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) are altered through genetic engineering to include traits not naturally found in the species. They can increase crop yields and reduce the need for pesticides, with Bt corn being a notable example of a pest-resistant GMO. However, GMOs are controversial due to potential long-term health effects, environmental impacts, and ethical concerns. Critics argue about the risks to biodiversity and the need for more comprehensive safety studies.</p>
